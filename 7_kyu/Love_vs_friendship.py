# Kata: Love or friendship
# https://www.codewars.com/kata/59706036f6e5d1e22d000016

# If　a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

# Then l + o + v + e = 54

# and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

# So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

# The input will always be in lowercase and never be empty.
